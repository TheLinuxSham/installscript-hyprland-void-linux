This is a small install script for Hyprland on Void Linux.

This script ensures the availability of the official [void packages](https://github.com/void-linux/void-packages) on the local system, as well as the [template](https://github.com/Makrennel/hyprland-void) for Hyprland. It will install Hyprland, XDG-Desktop-Portals-Hyprland and Hyprpaper.

In short: it will download, install and update automatically.
